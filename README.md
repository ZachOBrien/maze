Maze is an implementation of the board game "Labyrinth". The real game involves players navigating a maze, represented as a physical grid board of pathways, with the objective of collecting treasure.

This repository implements a client-server architecture and basic GUI for configuring and observing the game. To find more information on each of these architectural components, see the `README` in their respective directories.
